# Personal-Projects
This repository stores my personal as well as academic projects which I created on my free time. This code is not meant to be professionally done but to learn about different libaries, functionalities, and algorithms. 

The gfg folder stores a web scraper I made as a project to test how data retrieval and topic determination.
The CNN jupytr file is a convolutional neural network made using tensorflow.
The jobsearch.py is a crewAI agent I made to test out the functionality of the library and to see what APIs can be integrated such as Whisper API and Serper API.
